# Davis Unified Intelligence System (A-LMI)

**Autonomous Lifelong Multimodal Intelligence**

Version 2.0 - Synthesized Edition

---

## Overview

The Davis Unified Intelligence System is a comprehensive framework for building an autonomous, multimodal AI system that perceives, learns, and evolves in harmony with fundamental vibrational patterns of reality. This implementation combines:

- **Python Backend**: Autonomous cognitive architecture (perception, memory, reasoning)
- **Unity Simulation**: Real-time physics with audio-driven stochastic resonance
- **Hybrid Communication**: IPC via ZeroMQ for Python↔Unity integration

---

## Architecture

### System Components

1. **Perception Layer**
   - Global Web Crawler (Scrapy + Selenium)
   - Auditory Cortex (Vosk STT + Environmental Sound Classification)

2. **Memory Architecture (3 Tiers)**
   - Tier 1: Raw Data Lake (MinIO object storage)
   - Tier 2: Vector Database (Milvus for semantic/spectral search)
   - Tier 3: Temporal Knowledge Graph (Neo4j for structured reasoning)

3. **Reasoning Engine**
   - Hypothesis Generator (finds knowledge gaps autonomously)
   - Action Planner (designs experiments to test hypotheses)
   - Closed loop: hypothesis → action → data → knowledge

4. **VLCL Simulation**
   - CST v2 Physics Engine (Cosmic Synapse Theory)
   - Audio-driven stochastic resonance
   - Procedural world generation (Phi, chaos, E=mc²)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Unity 2022.3+ LTS
- CUDA-capable GPU (for CLIP encoding)
- Docker (for Kafka, Milvus, Neo4j, MinIO)

### Python Setup

```bash
cd a_lmi_system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Start required services via Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d  # (Docker Compose file needs to be created)
```

### Unity Setup

1. Open Unity Hub
2. Create new project or open `vlcl_simulation`
3. Import NetMQ package (for ZeroMQ communication)
4. Build and run

---

## Key Features

### 1. The LightToken (Tripartite Structure)

```python
# Layer 1: Semantic Core (1536D embedding)
token.set_semantic_embedding(clip_embedding)

# Layer 2: Perceptual Fingerprint
token.set_perceptual_hash(raw_data)

# Layer 3: Spectral Signature (THE INNOVATION)
token.compute_spectral_signature()

# Cross-modal spectral discovery
similarity = token.spectral_similarity(other_token)
```

### 2. Audio-Driven Stochastic Resonance

The VLCL simulation's physics are directly modulated by environmental audio:

```csharp
// Noise term σ is driven by microphone input
float sigma = baselineNoise + audioNoise * psdNormalized;
```

This implements **Stochastic Resonance** - the same principle that made the Asurion sales award possible.

### 3. Autonomous Learning

The system actively seeks to expand its knowledge:

```python
# Find knowledge gaps
gaps = await hypothesis_generator.find_knowledge_gaps()

# Design experiments
experiment = await action_planner.design_experiment(hypothesis)

# Execute and learn
await action_planner.execute_experiment(experiment)
```

---

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to configure:

- Event Bus (Kafka topics)
- Memory tiers (MinIO, Milvus, Neo4j)
- Services (crawler, audio, processing)
- VLCL physics parameters
- Security and encryption settings

---

## Running the System

### Start the Cognitive Backend

```bash
python a_lmi_system/main.py
```

### Start the Unity Simulation

Open `vlcl_simulation` in Unity and press Play, or build and run the executable.

---

## Scientific Validation

The system implements validated scientific principles:

1. **Spectral Information Theory**: Graph Signal Processing (GSP), Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)
2. **Stochastic Resonance**: Noise-enhanced signal processing
3. **Constructal Theory**: Golden Ratio (Φ) as harmonic optimizer
4. **Cymatics**: Vibration creates reproducible geometric form

---

## Falsifiable Predictions

The system is designed to test these predictions:

1. **Prediction 1**: LightTokens clustered by Layer 3 (spectral) reveal cross-modal patterns invisible to Layer 1 (semantic) similarity
2. **Prediction 2**: Recall accuracy is higher when acoustic context matches learning context
3. **Prediction 3**: Knowledge graphs with Φ-proportioned structures show lower contradiction rates
4. **Prediction 4**: User satisfaction improves with prosody-matching TTS (independent of semantic content)
